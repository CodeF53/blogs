## Intro
If you watch youtube you have probably seen countless sponsors for buying a domain.

Up until recently I really didnt feel a need to, but after making my Personal Site, I felt like it would be nice to have a proper domain instead of `https://codef53.github.io/personal-site/`.

## Thinking of a name
I thought of this last night in my sleep, I woke up with the excellent idea of buying `https://f53.dev`. It would be a double win, I have a fun URL and a intresting topic for blog.

I dont recommend this strategy:
- sleeping is an unreliable method for brainstorming
- you should have more reason for buying and making a website than
    - I thought of f53.dev in my sleep
    - it would work well for a blog post

## Trying to find where to buy it.

I went to the top 6 results that looked like they were actually selling domains, looked up F53.dev, and noted their prices.

| Store | Price |
|---|---|
|Bluehost|unavailable|
|MailChimp|unavailable|
|GoDaddy|$20 (for the first year)|
|Domain.com|$15 + $9 upsell + scare tactics for removing upsell|
|Google|$12|
|NameCheap|$13|

This made Google the clear winner, but it may not be as clear cut for you.

In your own search, some of the other services may look cheaper, but will have a big asterisk of "(for the first year)" meaning they will charge more per year afterwards.

## Linking a github pages site to a url you own
### Is it Possible?
Before I buy, I want to check if its even possible to do this, because I dont want to have to also start paying for a server to host stuff.

[Here are the docs on this exact thing](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), they are pretty indepth, so yeah, it looks like this is indeed a thing you can do. They basically immediatly require you work with your DNS Provider*, so there is no testing the waters before you buy your domain.

\* For clarification, DNS Provider here is Domain Name Service Provider, which for me is Google Domains

### Going through with it.
