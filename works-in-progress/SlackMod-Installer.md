## Intro 
This is a continuation of my Series of Blogs documenting my process of making a custom mod for Slack:
- [Initial Creation of the Project](https://dev.to/f53/adding-a-custom-css-menu-to-slack-1090), discusses:
    - why I am making it
    - how I inject into Slack
    - problem solving the unique challenges that come with client modding
    - very basic text editor that is linked to css
- [Improving the Editor](upcoming), discusses:
    - learning from other open source works
    - adding an editor with Ace
    - localStorage, a simple way to make saves persist.

Last blog left off with a finalized Custom CSS editor the following note:
> Given my list of issues from last blog, here is what I have left to do:
> - Injecting is manual and hardcoded to the user's system
>   - I think I will make my next blog on this, followed by a tutorial on how to install it on your own slack!
