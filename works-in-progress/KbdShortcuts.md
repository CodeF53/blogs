### <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>

Unless you have 2 displays, you have 2 options for editing your code while looking at its result in a browser:

Split Screen where there isn't enough room for your code or your browser to be comfortable to use

Or switching between your windows, giving plenty of room to breath in both your editor and your browser

Most people opt for the second option, which I do. Most people seem to use their bottom task bar for this though. Please use <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> instead.

Here is how it works:

Press and hold <kbd>alt</kbd> and tap <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>

You will see a list of your open windows in some form, ordered by how recently you opened them.

Pressing <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> additional times advances the window it will focus.

When you have the window you want to focus highlighted, let go of <kbd>alt</kbd>

### tab switching:

Most people do actually alt+tab, but something nearly everybody does is use the tab gui to switch tabs

Switching between browser or editor tabs with your mouse is a pain.

#### VSCode:

Switching tabs in VSCode is similar to <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>ing.

Press and hold <kbd>ctrl</kbd> and tap <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>

This opens a list of your currently open VSCode tabs.

Pressing <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> additional times advances the tab it will focus.

When you have the tab you want to focus highlighted, let go of <kbd>ctrl</kbd>

#### Firefox/Chrome:

Firefox and Chrome work exactly like vscode, but don't have a nice list preview for all your tabs

#### Improved Firefox <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> menu

You can improve firefox so it has this nice list preview though:

Go to `about:config` in firefox

Search ctrltab, and double click `browser.ctrlTab.sortByRecentlyUsed` to change `false` to `true`

Now when you <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>, you get a nice windows alttab menu like thing.

#### Improving Chrome (windows only)

*chrome's webstore has a strict verification process, so this is safe, despite it looking incredibly sus*

Install the [Tab Thumbnails Switcher extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-thumbnails-switcher/jpaiaplhepeiilhiegfnknedhjepknng/) and run the executable `Native-Component.exe` it downloads.

Once you do this you *should* have nice tab previews <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>

I don't use Windows or Chrome, so I cant 100% confirm this.

### Moving Through and Editing text quickly

#### improving the arrow keys (<kbd>‚Üê</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üí</kbd>)

When you hold <kbd>ctrl</kbd> and press the l/r arrow keys <kbd>‚Üê</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üí</kbd>, it snaps the cursor to the next word border.

When you hold <kbd>shift</kbd> and press the l/r arrow keys <kbd>‚Üê</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üí</kbd>, it selects one character left or right.

Combining these two lets you quickly select some code and edit it.

#### vscode specific shortcut <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+(<kbd>ü†ï</kbd>/<kbd>ü†ó</kbd>)

Doing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+(<kbd>ü†ï</kbd>/<kbd>ü†ó</kbd>) creates a duplicate cursor above/below your current one, letting you add text to multiple lines at once
