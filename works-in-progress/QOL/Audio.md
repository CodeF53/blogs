## What to buy
### Over Ears
The hands-down best set of budget over ear headphones are the [Samson SR850s](https://amzn.com/dp/B002LBSEQS)

They tend to go for $50-$30 dollars on Amazon, here is a chart of their price over time:\

The reason they go for so cheap while being so good is because they are a blatant clone of the AKG K240s, studio headphones that usually go for ~$100.

They are open backs, meaning they have excellent imaging with the tradeoffs of noticeable bleed and lacking isolation:
- Imaging is how easy it is to tell where sounds are happening around you, necessary for pinpointing footsteps in gaming. These have EXCELLENT imaging.
- Bleed is how much sound leaves the headphones that others can hear. Its not that bad, but someone sitting next to you will hear what your listening to.
- Isolation is how much putting on headphones reduces your ability to hear whats happening around you. These don't have that, putting them on has a near-zero impact on what you can hear.

This makes them ideal for use at home, but I wouldn't use them in a public place. Thats what my other recommendations are for
