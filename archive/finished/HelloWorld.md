# Intro to my blog
I have been doing random programming projects for a long time now. I am going to be posting some of the highlights of my past works here alongside my new work.

# Prior Education/Work History Summary.
## Education
Just before starting high school I took a introductory summer course to C++.
I took AP computer science in my first two years of highschool (java). 
That was followed by data structures and algorithms and intro to machine learning(python) in the last 2 years.

Also during highschool I took AP Statistics & AP Physics, getting a 5(that is really good) in the tests for both. 

## Between Highschool and Flatiron
I was planning on taking a trade school instantly after getting out of highschool, but covid hit, so all in-person classes were unavailable.
Because of that, I took a gap year waiting for classes to open back up.

During that time I began working on mod development for Minecraft. I have published most of my work on my [Github](https://github.com/CodeF53) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/F53).
